This project focuses on predicting Airbnb rental prices using neural networks, aiming to optimize pricing strategies for hosts and provide valuable insights into market trends for renters. By leveraging a dataset that includes features such as location, property type, amenities, and historical prices, the neural network model is trained to accurately forecast rental prices based on various influencing factors.
