Designed Face Image Super Resolution model using GAN, which outperformed alternative methods including Bilinear, Bicubic Interpolations and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The GAN-generated images achieved realistic outcomes with an impressive 8x upscaling, effectively capturing intricate facial details that were previously unattainable with other approaches
