👨‍🎓 I completed my Master's in Computer Engineering at  [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/)(March'24), equipping me with a robust foundation for addressing intricate problems.

👨‍💻 I am working  as a Software Developer Full Stack at [BlockConvey](https://www.blockconvey.com/).  

I excel as a full-stack developer, crafting dynamic user experiences with React in the front end and powering the back end with Java and Python's versatility.

I'm actively seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills in coding and finding efficient solutions.

Together, we can build the code of tomorrow!
